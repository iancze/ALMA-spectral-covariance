# Dirty beam channel experiments

[x] Get small array configuration of real data
[x] Make fake data, small in number. Include channel-to-channel correlations. No signal, just noise draws.

* Image and make beam.

* Calculate covariances empirically
* Use to calculate covariances
* Compared to derived expressions.
